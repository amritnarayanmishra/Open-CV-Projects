✋ Hand Gesture Controlled LED System (ESP32 + OpenCV)

This is a fun and futuristic project where you can control LEDs using your hand gestures — no buttons, no touching!
Just show your fingers in front of your laptop webcam and the LEDs connected to ESP32 will turn ON/OFF instantly. 🚀

This project combines:

ESP32 Web Server (for LED control)

Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe (for hand gesture detection)

Wi-Fi Communication between PC & ESP32

⭐ What this project can do?
Gesture (Fingers)	What Happens
✊ 0 Fingers	All LEDs Turn OFF
☝️ 1 Finger	LED1 ON
✌️ 2 Fingers	LED1 OFF
🤟 3 Fingers	LED2 ON
✋ 4 Fingers	LED2 OFF
🖐️ 5 Fingers	All LEDs ON

Very simple and cool to show in college projects and demos 😎

🧰 Hardware Used

ESP32 Development Board

2× LEDs

2× 330Ω Resistors

Breadboard + Jumper Wires

Laptop with Webcam

Wi-Fi Router (Same network for ESP32 & Laptop)

🔌 Circuit Connection
ESP32 Pin	LED
GPIO 2 (D4)	LED1
GPIO 4 (D2)	LED2
GND	LED – through resistor

Just connect LED negative wire to GND via resistor. ✔️

💻 Software & Tools

VS Code → To run Python OpenCV program

Arduino IDE → To upload ESP32 code

Internet/Wi-Fi → To communicate

📚 Python Libraries Required

Run this in VS Code Terminal:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe requests


If pip gives issue, try:

python -m pip install opencv-python mediapipe requests

📚 ESP32 Libraries Required

Already built-in:

WiFi.h  
WebServer.h


➡ No extra installation needed!

🧠 How it actually works?

1️⃣ ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi & starts a tiny web-server
2️⃣ Python detects hand landmarks & counts fingers
3️⃣ Based on finger count → Python sends URL request to ESP32
4️⃣ ESP32 receives command → Turns LEDs ON/OFF

Example Request:

http://ESP32-IP/d4on


You’ll see ESP32 IP address in Serial Monitor (copy & paste into Python code)

📝 Important Tips

✔ Good lighting → Gesture accuracy will be high
✔ Keep your hand inside the webcam frame
✔ Use open palm for 5 fingers properly
✔ Make sure both devices are on same Wi-Fi

🎯 Why this project is useful?

Touchless control for safety (e.g., wet hands)

Smart homes

Gesture-Based IoT interface

Cool project for college submissions

Impressive for resume & demos 😎

🚀 Future Ideas

Add more appliances using Relay module

Use different gestures like swipe

Show LED status on a webpage

Add Voice + Gesture combo
